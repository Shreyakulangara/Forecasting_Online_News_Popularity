# Forecasting_Online_News_Popularity

People nowadays prefer reading news online rather than in newspapers. As a result, predicting the shares has become an important task. In this project, four supervised machine learning classifiers - Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost - have been used to predict the popularity of news. The research is based on a dataset from UCI, which primarily sources its data from Mashable News, one of the world's most prominent blogs. The number of shared articles is considered as the predictor of news popularity. The performance of the four models is evaluated by metrics such as Accuracy, Kappa Statistic, Recall, FP-Rate, Precision, F1-score and ROC Area values.  Among the four classifiers, Random Forest has emerged as the most effective prediction method with an accuracy of 71.52%.
